ANCM44916,Graduate,Open,Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM,"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion.","Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham",Regenstein Library 207,The Discovery of Paganism,1,[43840],[],SEM

The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century.

For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future.

Rather than understanding brains or genes as determinative and relatively immutable templates for human bodies and behaviors, researchers working on neuroplasticity and epigenetics have increasingly focused on understanding how social and material environments and experiences “get under the skin.” While many social scientists have welcomed these developments as validating long-held views about the social determination of health and illness, others have warned these seemingly paradigmatic shifts may only lead to new forms of reductionism. Perhaps most fundamentally, such emergent research has been described as the grounds for a renewed biosocial research agenda or for the rethinking of interdisciplinary work between the life and social sciences.

Literatures across the disciplines are full of living bodies and concrete experiences, object biographies, ‘theories of things,’ a return to ‘matter,’ ‘new’ materialisms spun out of ‘old’ ones… While generative, materiality’s ubiquity also betrays a gap, an ambiguity, an absence. For what materiality is exactly remains unsure. Some seem to use it as a descriptive shorthand for the material world. Others as an analytic tending to the materialness of existence. Or as a discourse on it. For others still, it denotes the tangible effects of actions, practice, signs, and thought. Or a framework for unpacking the relationships mediating between people and things… Conjurations abound, yet seldom escape a certain circularity (“materiality studies… materiality?”). The concept has been used to frame a near infinite horizon of topics, from artefacts, of course, to cosmology, faith, finance, and absence, encompassing phenomena both enduring and ephemeral, both there and not-there. In taking on so much, has materiality outlasted its usefulness? What analytic work did it perform in the first place? With these considerations as background, through classic and recent literatures, this seminar will examine the relevance of ‘materiality’ (epistemologically, conceptually, methodologically) to anthropologies of the contemporary world, at a time when the ontologies of old are dissolving into a bubbling landscape of mixtures, hybridities, and post-humanities, which forces us to rethink basic questions of identity, agency, ethics and politics.",Francois Richard,TBA,Materiality,1,[43532],[],SEM

Participants will see the Greeks emerge from poverty and anarchy to form a distinctive political and social system based on city-states—and they will see that system grow unstable and collapse. They will see the emergence of distinctive forms of sculpture, architecture, pottery, and urban design—many of which are still in use today. Along with these facts, they will acquire a conceptual toolkit for looking at works of art and for thinking about the relation of art to social life.

Rather than focusing on questions of style and subject matter, we will explore the visual “syntax” of photographic prints, exploring how the material aspects of their making can shape, alter, or determine meaning. Using materials from the Art Institute of Chicago’s Photography Collection, we will learn how to identify various kinds of photographic objects based on their visual and material attributes, building on that knowledge as a basis for art historical analysis, connoisseurship, and conservation. The course will follow a loose chronological structure, starting with early daguerreotypes and salted paper prints and ending with contemporary color and digital techniques. Along the way, we will consider: what makes photography a unified “medium”? How do the technical and aesthetic traditions of photography interact with one another? What makes some processes better suited to certain purposes than others? What variables do photographers consider while choosing a process or format?

We will include films (e.g. Rossellini’s “Germany Year Zero”), art (e.g. H. Robert, Piranesi) archaeology, and the museum (Soane). On ruins writing, we will read Thucydides, Pausanias from within antiquity, the Enlightenment responses to the destruction and archaeological rediscovery of Pompeii, Diderot, Simmel, Freud on the mind as levels of ruins (Rome) and the analysis as reconstructive archaeologist as well as on the novel Gradiva and the Acropolis, the Romantic obsession with ruins, and the firebombing in WWII. We will also consider the photographing of ruins, and passages from the best-known works on photography (Benjamin, Sontag, Ritchen, Fried, Azoulay). The goal is to see how ruin gazing, and its depictions (textual, imagistic, photographic, etc.) change from the ancients (Greek and Roman), to the Romantic use of ruins as a source of (pleasurable) melancholy, to the technological “advances” in targeting and decimating civilian populations that describe the Second Word War.","Jas Elsner, Francoise Meltzer",Regenstein Library 207,Ruins,1,[43836],[],SEM
ARTH40310,Graduate,Open,Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM,"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion.","Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham",Regenstein Library 207,The Discovery of Paganism,1,[43841],[],SEM
ARTH41610,Graduate,Open,Mon : 06:00 PM-08:50 PM,"Venice’s long-standing ties with the Byzantine Empire have left their visible trace in the city’s art and architecture and have had an equally strong impact on Venetian myth-making in the pre-modern period. Until today the appropriation of Byzantine style is especially evident in the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, as well as in the decoration of less-well known medieval churches of the Venetian Lagoon. During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research. On a broader scale, we will investigate various phenomena of cultural transfer and ‘hybridity’ from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era.",Karin Krause,Swift Hall 201,Between East and West: Venice in the Pre-Modern Period,1,[41404],[],SEM

As a result, the city itself has come to occupy a mythic position as a central hub of Western intellectual culture: uprooted from its geographical specificity by the circulation of such proper names as Machiavelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and unmoored from its historical heritage by the disorienting complexities of modern mass tourism. Therefore, this course seeks to re-integrate the “Renaissance” into the urban context from which it emerged, to defamiliarize it so that it can be looked at from other perspectives. It focuses on the city itself as the protagonist of some of the most important experiments in art, architecture, and urban development and shows how they were intimately connected to a lively and engaged social body. By approaching images and monuments through the spatial practices by which they were encountered by Renaissance society (rituals of conflict, contests, economic exchange, religious devotion, urban politics, identity formation, among others), students will gain a more nuanced understanding of the links between a localized urban culture and a larger intercultural and cross-temporal exchange of ideas.",Niall Atkinson,Campus North Res Commons 158,"Florentine Topographies: Art, Architecture, and Urban Life",1,[54588],[],SEM

Advances in genetic knowledge gained through sequencing have been applied to drug response, and identifying heritable genetic variants that predict response and toxicity is an area of great interest to researchers. The ultimate goal is to identify clinically significant variations to predict the right choice and dose of medications for individuals—""personalizing medicine."" The study of pharmacogenomics is complicated by the fact that response and toxicity are multigenic traits and are often confounded by nongenetic factors (e.g., age, co-morbidities, drug-drug interactions, environment, diet). Using knowledge of an individual's DNA sequence as an integral determinant of drug therapy has not yet become standard clinical practice; however, several genetics-guided recommendations for physicians have been developed and are highlighted. The ethics and economics of pharmacogenomics are also discussed.","R. Stephanie Huang, Barbara Stranger",TBA,Pharmacogenomics: Discovery and Implementation,1,[43382],[],SEM

BPRO24000,Undergraduate,Open,Mon : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM,"Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, but the concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives. Readings will be drawn from a wide array of disciplines including philosophy, classics, history, psychology, behavioral economics, medicine, and public policy.","W.

Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

Over the course of the term, we will read literature on teaching and learning and use that scholarship to reflect on our own teaching practice. We will start at the beginning by thinking first about how people learn. Next we will turn our attention to course design and consider what kind of structure will help us promote learning in our students. We then consider assessment: how do we know students are learning, and how can the work we assign them promote meaningful engagement with course material? We will then think about what happens in the classroom by exploring different teaching methods, and what can be said for (and against) them. We will also consider the issue of inclusion in the classroom, discussing how to create a welcoming and productive classroom environment. Alongside this process of reading, reflection, and discussion, students will also be engaged in designing a course of their own. This endeavor will take the form of a course design project, which should serve as the foundation for a course you plan to teach soon, either in the College, at a Chicago-area institution, or in your first year as a faculty member.

We will also consider the photographing of ruins, and passages from the best-known works on photography (Benjamin, Sontag, Ritchen, Fried, Azoulay). The goal is to see how ruin gazing, and its depictions (textual, imagistic, photographic, etc.) change from the ancients (Greek and Roman), to the Romantic use of ruins as a source of (pleasurable) melancholy, to the technological “advances” in targeting and decimating civilian populations that describe the Second Word War.","Jas Elsner, Francoise Meltzer",Regenstein Library 207,Ruins,1,[43835],[],SEM
CDIN40301,Graduate,Open,Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM,"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion.","Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham",Regenstein Library 207,The Discovery of Paganism,1,[43839],[],SEM

The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society.

Rather than understanding brains or genes as determinative and relatively immutable templates for human bodies and behaviors, researchers working on neuroplasticity and epigenetics have increasingly focused on understanding how social and material environments and experiences “get under the skin.” While many social scientists have welcomed these developments as validating long-held views about the social determination of health and illness, others have warned these seemingly paradigmatic shifts may only lead to new forms of reductionism. Perhaps most fundamentally, such emergent research has been described as the grounds for a renewed biosocial research agenda or for the rethinking of interdisciplinary work between the life and social sciences.

Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice.

The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it.

These supplementary readings will explore evaluative judgments, memory processes, and human perception, among other topics. We will examine various works of troubled genius, beginning with Vladimir Nabokov’s 1930 tale of chess and obsession, The Defense. Stefan Zweig’s own contribution in his 1941 Chess Story will round out our exploration of monomania and the tenuous boundaries of reason. Other authors of interest include Edgar Allan Poe, Samuel Beckett, Viktor Shklovskii, Johan Huizinga, Michel Foucault, H.Simon & W.Chase, et al.",Monica Felix,TBA,Dangerous Games,1,[54851],[],SEM

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).",Angelina Ilieva,Foster Hall 408,The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise,1,[42374],[],LEC

In the early twentieth century the novel-memoir becomes arguably the foremost vehicle for literary modernism. We will examine the literary strategies used to represent the workings of memory and the construction of their autobiographical worlds. What role does tradition play in foregrounding the writers’ approach to their immediate familial and cultural past? How is the experience of time reconfigured by the processes of memory, and what rhetorical techniques are used to effect this in prose narratives? Readings may include James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Andrei Bely’s Kotik Letaev, Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, Osip Mandelshtam’s The Noise of Time and Vladimir Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, as well as selections from Boris Pasternak, Marcel Proust, Andrei Platonov, Marina Tsvetaeva and others.

While in an age of global migrations, multilingual speakers have come to outnumber the number of monolingual speakers, literary studies continue to privilege works aimed at a monolingual audience. This is particularly the case in the United States, where “English-only” attitudes have dominated discourse for over a century.

From modernist collage and transense to contemporary poetry of exile, migration, and diaspora, the works we will study, lodged between tongues, lend nuance and fascination to debates surrounding “global literature” and untranslatability. We will examine the formal and social prompts and repercussions of experiments in polylingualism, barbarism, dialect, creole, and thwarted translation, and will delve into examples of the potential for mixed/new media poetics to accommodate multiple linguistic systems.

It is an atmosphere, mood or perhaps a theme that movies have explores since nearly the beginning of cinema (or perhaps even before..) To explore this term this class will draw largely on a tradition of commentary on the German word Das Unheimliche, usually translated as uncanny, that can be traced among Ernst Jentsch, Sigmund Freud, and Martin Heidegger and its relevance to film studies. Freud and his disciple Otto Rank before 1920 related the uncanny to the cinema, and cinema’s ability to evoke the uncanny has been frequently observed. On the one hand, the cinema’s ability to portray uncanny events (as in Rank and Freud’s invocation of the 1913 film the Student in Prague) appears generically in films of fantasy or horror. In addition, some theorists have felt that film as a medium could be best approached via the uncanny. In this class, we will read a series of the key texts and try to survey the terrain of the concept of the uncanny. We will screen films that evoke the experience through their narrative and stylistics, and we will discuss the usefulness of the term for theorizing both film and electronic media, both new and old.",Thomas R Gunning,Logan Center 801,The Uncanny in Cinema,1,[43909],"[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43910] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM', 'instructor': 'Gunning'}]",LEC

In a career spanning nearly three decades, Lubitsch’s name has come to denote a style about style, first exported from Germany to Hollywood and then from Hollywood to the world. In this sense, Lubitsch is first and foremost a filmmaker for filmmakers, and his style decidedly an international one. It is the goal of this course to examine a broadly defined international stylistic history developed by and associated with Lubitsch, whose legacy cannot be adequately assessed without such a perspective.

The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

Various traces of Japanese documentary filmmaking practice can be seen carried forward and extended in cinematic creations worldwide, from works by Chris Marker, Abbas Kiarostami and Wim Wenders to recent independent documentaries in East Asia.

In a career spanning nearly three decades, Lubitsch’s name has come to denote a style about style, first exported from Germany to Hollywood and then from Hollywood to the world. In this sense, Lubitsch is first and foremost a filmmaker for filmmakers, and his style decidedly an international one. It is the goal of this course to examine a broadly defined international stylistic history developed by and associated with Lubitsch, whose legacy cannot be adequately assessed without such a perspective.

The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society.

Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays? These questions will inform our study of the consolidation of a self-conscious Chicago literature and its attendant literary history.

It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities’ measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch and sophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Korea offers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorship operations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship. Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions of censorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics of Japanese colonial censorship in Korea.",Kyeong-Hee Choi,Wieboldt Hall 301N,Censorship in East Asia:  The Case of Colonial Korea,1,[53788],[],SEM

From Grotius to Vitoria through Hobbes and Locke up to Mill and beyond, the one thing that modernity’s self-possessive subject cannot will to alienate, sell, or give away is himself. From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation. This course will explore how this philosophical bracketing of the problem of auto-enslavement enabled Atlantic modernity to bracket slavery itself as an exceptional, pathological condition; we will then explore how the philosophical coding of humans as free by anthropological default affected the social, legal, and political life of the actually enslaved. The first part of this course will track the impossibilization of auto-enslavement in early modern and Enlightenment philosophical texts on international law, political theory, Biblical hermeneutics, and abolitionism.

Horror stories, considered broadly, go about this estranging work in more concerted ways, luring their characters into zones of emotional and perceptual extremity, violence, and metaphysical dislocation. In this course, we will pinpoint techniques used by (mostly) contemporary writers to deliver shades of fear in narratives rich enough to reward multiple readings. We’ll examine ways writers have engaged the tropes familiar to horror—e.g., doppelgangers, paranoia, the uncanny, the proximity of evil—in stories with complex characters, immersive sensory worlds, realistic social milieux, and potent ideas.

How does the image interface with formal attributes, such as sound, rhythm, and line breaks? Does a poetic image necessarily entail a representational mode of thinking, or are their variations that resist literary mimesis? Is abstraction really antithetical to the image, as is often assumed, or are there ways that, in poems, abstraction and imagery work in chorus? We will discuss radically different approaches to poetic image making (e.g. synesthetic, collaged, surrealist, eco-poetic, iterative, abstract, juxtapositional, absurdist, haiku, etc.) and the aesthetic effects and values that they entail. We will also compare poetry’s sensory images to select practices in music, painting, photography, and film.

We’ll spend most of our time evaluating student work, learning how to become both generous and rigorous critics, and we’ll also talk about the books that influenced us the most as young adult readers and the books we’re reading today, from contemporary writers like John Green and Rainbow Rowell to classic authors like S.E. Hinton and Madeleine L’Engle. Students will read at least one or two novels during the quarter as well. Instructor consent required. Submit writing sample via www.creativewriting.uchicago.edu.

CRWR32020,Graduate,Open,Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM,"Fiction has many strategies for defamiliarizing the familiar, for destabilizing the ways we habitually think and feel about ourselves and our realities. Horror stories, considered broadly, go about this estranging work in more concerted ways, luring their characters into zones of emotional and perceptual extremity, violence, and metaphysical dislocation. In this course, we will pinpoint techniques used by (mostly) contemporary writers to deliver shades of fear in narratives rich enough to reward multiple readings. We’ll examine ways writers have engaged the tropes familiar to horror—e.g., doppelgangers, paranoia, the uncanny, the proximity of evil—in stories with complex characters, immersive sensory worlds, realistic social milieux, and potent ideas. Special attention will be paid to the uses of voice, atmosphere, and narrative architecture. Readings may include Henry James, Paul Bowles, Angela Carter, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Munro, William Gay, David Foster Wallace, Reynolds Price, Mary Gaitskill, Kevin Brockmeier, and Karen Russell.

CRWR33017,Graduate,Open,Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM,"In this special topics course we will investigate and experiment with various approaches to imagery. Some fundamental questions will include: What are the variants of the image in poetry, and how do these variants create different stances in the poem? How does the image interface with formal attributes, such as sound, rhythm, and line breaks? Does a poetic image necessarily entail a representational mode of thinking, or are their variations that resist literary mimesis? Is abstraction really antithetical to the image, as is often assumed, or are there ways that, in poems, abstraction and imagery work in chorus? We will discuss radically different approaches to poetic image making (e.g. synesthetic, collaged, surrealist, eco-poetic, iterative, abstract, juxtapositional, absurdist, haiku, etc.) and the aesthetic effects and values that they entail. We will also compare poetry’s sensory images to select practices in music, painting, photography, and film. Workshop discussions will focus on sensory elements of students’ poems and the poem as an organ of perception and feelings. Readings may include work by Bernard Badiou, Charles Baudelaire, André Breton, Mark Doty, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, H.D., Elizabeth Bishop, Jared Stanley, Mei Mei Berssenbrugge, Francis Ponge, and others.

It will offer students a chance to try their hands at a range of tactics of translation. Invited speakers with expertise in different languages and methods of translation will supplement our group readings in such authors as Dante, Petrarch, Chaucer, Wyatt, Shelley, Paz, Weinberger, Benjamin, Venuti, Celan, De Campos, Zukofsky, Erin Mouré, Etel Adnan, Anne Carson, and John Cayley.",Jennifer Scappettone,Logan Center 802,Advanced Translation Workshop: Found in Translation,1,[53619],[],SEM

On the one hand, mystery writing in Japanese has proven to be a resilient and popular brand of “low” culture, often excluded from the realm of “pure” literature due to its focus on violence, lawlessness, and perversity. On the other, the treatment of these recurring themes according to established “rules” of the mystery genre has helped promote the creation of a reading public that shares a set of taboos and mores. Meanwhile, the problems tackled incisively by Japanese mystery works are often reflections of the larger societal problems posed by their time—including Westernization, imperial expansion, defeat in the Second World War, the arrival of economic prosperity, the collapse of the bubble economy, political corruption, and a perception of decline in the cohesiveness of community. Through examining mysteries, we will hope to arrive at a better understanding of how Japanese literature and society speak to and alter one another.

With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship.

Our primary texts come from popular culture, film, visual art, and literature, which have provided lightning rods for controversy and protest in this charged climate. This course investigates the fraught relationship between marginal expressions of gender and sexuality on the one hand, and society’s notions of security and safety on the other. Whose safety matters? How do women and other minorities use artistic production, within and alongside the realm of popular culture, to advocate for their own conceptions of safety and what it might mean? From the erotic performance of feminine agency found in soft-core pornographic pink films, to the slippage between fantasy and reality found in the staged violence of women’s pro-wrestling, to the eco-feminism of activist Ishimure Michiko, and beyond, this course will explore the state of gender, femininity, and sexual politics in Japan, from the 1960s on into the present day.",Marianne Tarcov,TBA,"Gender, Sexuality, Security Culture, and Protest in Post 3-11 Japan",1,[53656],"[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [53657] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM', 'instructor': 'Staff'}]",LEC

""Modern"" in the context of this course signifies a period in which China faced radical new paradigms for the role of sex and the meaning of gender. Although much that we will read describes the twentieth century, we will also discover that innovations in gender roles are not unique to the past hundred years. Nor, despite long-standing stereotypes to the contrary, has it only been the privilege of the elites to disrupt the traditional male-female binary. Readings will address such themes as the ways in which gender defines patterns in family life, in politics and under the law; marriage and homosexuality; prostitution and trafficking; performance and cross dressing; the implementation of the one child policy; gender roles in minority communities; and China's handling of HIV/AIDS. We will consider the role of old Confucian hierarchies and scrutinize the links between industrialization, women's liberation, nationalism, and the communist movement.

With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship.

In addition to situating the Chinese legal materials in their varying legal, social, political, cultural and historical contexts, and thereby highlighting some of their unique elements, the course also familiarizes students with a wide range of theoretical materials (eg., anthropological, legal philosophical, economic, etc.) which may be useful in bringing to light any universalities of legal systems and behavior.

The Chinese materials, all readings of which will be in translation, range from commemorative inscriptions cast in bronze sacral vessels and descriptions of legal practices in received texts, to actual statutes and case records, philosophical texts and legal debates. The medium, discovery/transmission, and authorship of each document will be given due consideration for the effect they may have on our understanding of the contemporary legal context from which the text derives. The course culminates with student presentations on the material of their choice. Preparation for presentations will be conducted in consult with the instructor. Students are encouraged to draw from their study of other legal systems and/or systems of legal thought (both modern and pre-modern) in their discussion of the ancient Chinese material.

ENGL17818,Undergraduate,Open,Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM,"In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft.

We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography to its original context.

ENGL21006,Undergraduate,Open,Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM,"Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice.

Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays? These questions will inform our study of the consolidation of a self-conscious Chicago literature and its attendant literary history. Students of the course will therefore not only become familiar with exciting works of textual art, they will also study the institutional context that enables the consolidation of “a literature,” and a “literary history.” Authors will include José Antonio Villarreal, Tomás Rivera, Rudolfo Anaya, Cherríe Moraga, Ana Castillo, and Gloria Anzaldúa.

In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley.

At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law. Finally, we will interrogate how the unconscious operates as a site of theoretical interest within Marxist and postcolonial critiques of modern imperialism.

From Grotius to Vitoria through Hobbes and Locke up to Mill and beyond, the one thing that modernity’s self-possessive subject cannot will to alienate, sell, or give away is himself. From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation. This course will explore how this philosophical bracketing of the problem of auto-enslavement enabled Atlantic modernity to bracket slavery itself as an exceptional, pathological condition; we will then explore how the philosophical coding of humans as free by anthropological default affected the social, legal, and political life of the actually enslaved.

FNDL21006,Undergraduate,Open,Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM,"Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice.

The historical and contemporary texts assigned draw attention to the layered and shifting meanings of these categories, and in turn to the geopolitical and epistomological worlds that give rise to them.

Taking works by Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Charles Dickens, Henry Mayhew, Thomas Hardy, and Henry James as our principle points of departure, our course will pursue the “Victorian unconscious” through three lines of questioning: First, we will ask how Victorian literature anticipated the development of psychoanalytic concepts, such as the unconscious, repression, infantile sexuality and the symptom. At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law. Finally, we will interrogate how the unconscious operates as a site of theoretical interest within Marxist and postcolonial critiques of modern imperialism.

One of the most prominent features of life in the modern metropolis, as noted by contemporaries, was its fragmentary character, both in social terms—the atomization of society as a whole—and in mental terms—the psychic instability of the atomized individual. This course explores a variety of critical and artistic responses to fragmentation: critical efforts to render the fragmented urban landscape legible, and literary and other artistic efforts to explore the potentialities of fragmentation through innovative forms and techniques. The main part of the course will focus on the Weimar period: literature, film and criticism of the Golden Twenties.

Until today the appropriation of Byzantine style is especially evident in the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, as well as in the decoration of less-well known medieval churches of the Venetian Lagoon. During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research.

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains.

The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).",Angelina Ilieva,Foster Hall 408,The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise,1,[42376],[],LEC

Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing).

What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region?

They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains. This course will introduce students to a diversity of scientific practices that flourished in the Hispanic world between 1400 and 1800.",Valeria Lopez Fadul,TBA,"Nature, Science, and Empire in the Early Modern Iberian World, 1400-1800",1,[42927],[],SEM

HIST26126,Undergraduate,Open,Mon Wed : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM,"In the span of three centuries the country we now recognize as Spain went from being a collection of kingdoms in the war-torn Iberian Peninsula of the fifteenth century to a global empire in the sixteenth, to an empire on the verge of collapse in the seventeenth, and finally to a revitalized empire in the eighteenth century. This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to ""civilize"" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic.

Many of the chief theoretical concerns of the Intelligentsia (the role of the public intellectual in society, the expression of dissidence and the ethics of exile) have preoccupied thinkers since Socrates. What distinguishes the Intelligentsia from other models of public intellectualism? How have various Slavic public intellectuals maintained, or broken with, this tradition? In order to establish a theoretical vocabulary, the course will begin with an introduction to several classical and contemporary theories of the role of the intellectual in society. We will then ground our inquiry in the historical invention of the Russian Intelligentsia during the mid-19th Century before setting off to analyze its 20th and 21st-century manifestations. Throughout the course, our main goal will be to examine the ways in which these thinkers conceive of and perform the role of a “public intellectual.” How do they balance the tasks of documenting and participating in the historical events they describe?

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).",Angelina Ilieva,Foster Hall 408,The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise,1,[42377],[],LEC

Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing).

KNOW40301,Graduate,Open,Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM,"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion.","Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham",Regenstein Library 207,The Discovery of Paganism,1,[43845],[],SEM

This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to ""civilize"" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic.

Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains.

For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future.

Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion.","Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham",Regenstein Library 207,The Discovery of Paganism,1,[43846],[],SEM

LAWS42603,Law School,Closed,Mon : 08:30 AM-11:40 AM,"(++, BID, CORE, DOC) This course uses the case method to study the practical aspects of important topics in corporate and entrepreneurial finance. We will apply the concepts and techniques of corporate finance to actual situations. The course is roughly divided into three sections: (1) financing decisions; (2) investment decisions; (3) entrepreneurial finance; and (4) private equity finance. In addition to analyzing the specific financing problems or issues, we will consider how those issues relate to the strategic objectives of the firm. It will be important to examine the ""big picture"" assumptions that are used in the numerical calculations. This course also places a strong emphasis on presentation and discussion skills. It will be important to explain your positions or arguments to each other and to try to argue for the implementation of your recommendations. COURSE PROCEDURES For each class meeting, I will assign study questions concerning one or two case studies. For most of the class period, we will consider the questions and the material in the cases. This includes the first meeting. You are allowed and encouraged, but not required to meet in groups outside of class to discuss and analyze the cases. Each group will submit a two-page memorandum of analysis and recommendations at the beginning of each case discussion. If you are working in a group, I will accept one memorandum from the group and count it for all students in the group. If you choose to do this, the group can include up to 3 students. Each memorandum should be typed and double-spaced. Write these as if you were writing a recommendation to the CEO or major decision maker in the case. The two page limit is for text only. You may attach as many numerical calculations as you wish. Memoranda will not be accepted after the class has met. A memorandum will be given credit if it is handed in and no credit if it is not. Initially, therefore, I will not grade them. However, I will use the memoranda to determine final grades for those students who are on the border of two grades. You should prepare a memorandum for UST, the first class. The readings and articles that I have assigned and will hand out are largely non-technical in nature and summarize the findings of academic research in corporate finance in the recent past. These articles are meant to be background material that will help you analyze the cases. They should not necessarily be cited in the case discussion. You should argue as if you were in a corporate boardroom rather than in a doctoral seminar. The process of arriving at the answer is as important as getting the answer. Because of the nature of this course (and its grading criteria), it is extremely important that you attend every class, arrive on time and be prepared to participate. To help me out, you should bring your name cards to each class. I may not remember who said what without those cards. In the past, students have asked me to hand out my case analysis after the class has discussed the case. I will not do this, because there are usually no absolute right answers. The best cases are deliberately written to be ambiguous. While there are no right answers, there are good arguments and bad arguments. This course is designed to help you learn to distinguish between sensible and senseless arguments. Handing out my analyses would reduce the ambiguity in the cases and partially defeat the purpose of doing cases. If you are uncomfortable with ambiguity, this class may not be for you.

There is no assumption of advanced skill or training in economics and no complex mathematical or economic tools are required. Antitrust has been defined not by rulemaking and statutory expansion, but by judges deciding cases, one at a time, in the common law tradition, in large part because the antitrust statutes are very terse and compact (unlike statues in other business fields such as securities regulation, banking regulation and the regulation of telecommunications). Most antitrust issues have been back and forth to the Supreme Court repeatedly. This allows students to see how succeeding generations of great judges have wrestled with the core issues in the field.

Not surprisingly, though, Supreme Court Justices both before and since have bitterly contested the precise scope of students' constitutional rights in the elementary and secondary school contexts. Some Justices, moreover, have concluded that it is typically unwise for the judiciary to enter the educational realm, lest the Supreme Court turn into a schoolboard for the entire nation. Even if such fears are overblown, however, there can be no doubt that the Court's constitutional interpretations have had significant consequences for schools charged with transforming students into citizens.

LAWS43248,Law School,Closed,Tue : 09:45 AM-01:15 PM,"(++, SKLL, BID, CORE, DOC) This course is designed to refresh your knowledge of basic financial accounting [first two weeks of class] and then aims to aggressively increase your ability to be a highly sophisticated user of financial statements. After taking this course, you should improve your ability to determine a firm's accounting policy for a particular type of transaction and to determine how that policy choice affects its primary financial statements. You will also learn how to question whether these effects fairly reflect the underlying economics of the firm's transactions. Asking these questions involves an interplay between accounting, economics, finance, law and business strategy. You should therefore greatly improve your ability to use an accounting report as part of an overall assessment of the firm's strategy and the potential rewards and risks of dealing with the firm. The teaching approach will be a roughly equal combination of lecture time and demanding case applications of the lecture material that will involve group case assignments that will form the basis for in-class discussion of the cases. The technical knowledge acquired from the lecture material is applied to cases where the main goal is to examine how the reported financial statements would differ if the firm had used different accounting policies. The focus is on modifying the reported financial statements in order to obtain the cleanest possible inputs for use in such applications as equity valuation, transaction structuring and credit analysis. The topics to be discussed are likely to include the accounting for, and interpretation of: revenue recognition, intercorporate investments, organizational structures (e.g., franchising), debt, and leases.

It involves a transaction in which an investor in one country (home state) sends capital to another (host state). But in many cases the transaction is subject to what is called in economics a dynamic inconsistency problem, in which the host state’s incentives change once the investment is sunk, and it may want to renege on its promises to the investor. Furthermore, neither side is likely to want any disputes adjudicated in the courts of the other’s country. The global investment regime has arisen to help resolve these problems. The regime includes bilateral investment treaties (known as BITs) as well as multilateral agreements that are embedded in broader treaty structures, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the Energy Charter Treaty. This seminar will introduce students to the operation of the investment law regime, with an emphasis on the tensions between home and host states, the impact of the regime on development outcomes, and the relationship between law and arbitration.

These questions include: Do legal rules really constrain judicial decision-making? What makes a rule (or norm) a rule of the legal system? Are principles of morality legally binding even when such principles have not been enacted into a law by a legislature? (Relatedly, are there objective principles of morality?) When no legal norm controls a case, how ought judges to decide that case? Can there be right answers to legal disputes, even when informed judges and lawyers disagree about the answer? Are there principles or methods of legal reasoning that constrain judicial decision-making, or is legal reasoning essentially indeterminate, such that a skillful judge can justify more than one outcome for any given dispute? Is judicial decision-making really distinct from political decision-making of the sort legislators engage in?

China is growing stronger and more influential in every domain worldwide and likely to increasingly threaten the status quo. The U.S., meanwhile, finds itself in the grips of a populist movement led by President Trump, who is openly critical of China. The relationship, which was already mistrustful, has grown even more fragile and anxious in recent weeks with talk of tariffs, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. The accusations and threats suggest that we are likely to witness greater turbulence than what we have experienced in the past forty years. The reality is that both nations need each other; both have significant economic, political, and security interests at stake. If the two nations learn how to collaborate, they could conceivably solve the world’s greatest problems. Alternatively, if they elect to contest each other at every turn, the result will be global instability and crisis. Clearly, a new framework for cooperation and collaboration is needed – quite possibly “a new deal,” in the language of President Trump. What will constitute such a deal? How will it work? How likely is a deal, and, if one does occur, will it survive the volatility of an America First foreign policy?

Increasingly, regulatory rules are becoming more complex and authorities are becoming more unforgiving, with stepped up efforts to secure criminal and civil penalties against companies, their executives, lawyers and auditors.

Students will serve as law clerks to justices of the Hopi Appellate Court, doing legal research, writing bench memoranda, and drafting opinions on live cases. Students will do all their coursework and assigned casework at the University of Chicago with site visits to the respective Hopi legal institutions to attend oral arguments, present findings to Hopi tribal officials, and participate in judicial deliberations. In so doing, they will be directly involved in testing the socio-legal principles, theories and critiques they explore in class in the crucible of the work they do helping to lay the regulatory and legal foundations for Hopi tribal institutions. In this practicum, almost every project that a student will work on will involve important questions of first impression with respect to a wide variety of pressing, yet enduring sociolegal issues, including issues of constitutionalism (separations of powers, checks and balances, etc.), crime and punishment (criminal law enforcement and defendants' and victims' rights), civil procedure (due process, appellate procedure, motions and orders), private law (property, contract, family), pluralism (the role of Anglo-American vs. Hopi traditional norms, and alternative dispute resolution), among many others. Given the centrality of these issues to the philosophy, social science, and practice of law - whether in the context of indigenous self-governance and settler colonialism, or otherwise -we believe that there are few other opportunities like this one, where students will encounter, explore and work through, the profound governance and legal issues and discussions offered by the Hopi Tribal Law Practicum.","M.

In addition to situating the Chinese legal materials in their varying legal, social, political, cultural and historical contexts, and thereby highlighting some of their unique elements, the course also familiarizes students with a wide range of theoretical materials (eg., anthropological, legal philosophical, economic, etc.) which may be useful in bringing to light any universalities of legal systems and behavior.

The Chinese materials, all readings of which will be in translation, range from commemorative inscriptions cast in bronze sacral vessels and descriptions of legal practices in received texts, to actual statutes and case records, philosophical texts and legal debates. The medium, discovery/transmission, and authorship of each document will be given due consideration for the effect they may have on our understanding of the contemporary legal context from which the text derives. The course culminates with student presentations on the material of their choice. Preparation for presentations will be conducted in consult with the instructor. Students are encouraged to draw from their study of other legal systems and/or systems of legal thought (both modern and pre-modern) in their discussion of the ancient Chinese material.

Direct Client Service: Pursuant to federal law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the Young Center is appointed as Child Advocate for the most vulnerable of these children (tender age children, children with mental or physical disabilities, children who have experienced extensive trauma, etc.). Law students serve as Child Advocate for individual children, and are responsible for advocating for the best interests of the assigned child on issues relating to safe repatriation, legal relief, care, custody and release. Each student meets weekly with the child at the detention facility, and advocates on behalf of the child with federal officials, including immigration judges and asylum officers, under the supervision of Young Center attorneys. Since there currently is no substantive best interests of the child standard under the Immigration and Nationality Act, students look to international human rights law, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, state child welfare law, and the child protection laws of the child’s home country.

But what are the different options for teaching precollegiate philosophy and which are best? That is the main question that this course will address. Students in this course will also have the opportunity to include an experiential learning component by participating in the UChicago Winning Words precollegiate philosophy program.

We begin by surveying the development and trajectory of the field, particularly as it develops around debates on revolution and compromise, cosmopolitanism, the psychology of colonialism, and anti-colonial historiography. Alongside this, we consider the recent disciplinary revival of the categories of “global Anglophone” and “world literature” through readings on “literary worlds” to to evaluate these categories, and their contributions to ongoing debates about translation/translatability, vernaculars, rewriting, and mimicry. What are the claims made on behalf of literary texts in orienting us to other lives and possibilities, and in registering the experience of geographic and cultural displacement? To better answer this, we read recent scholarship that engages the field in conversations around intimacy, belonging, and human rights, to think about the impulses that animate the field, and its possible futures. Readings will likely include works by Debjani Ganguly, Kamau Brathwaite, Jean Rhys, Amitava Kumar, Sara Ahmed and Amitav Ghosh.",Darrel Chia,TBA,Postcolonial Openings,1,[54368],[],SEM
MAPH36750,Graduate,Open,Mon : 12:30 PM-03:20 PM,"The phenomenon of anxiety emerged as one of the leading psychological disorders of the 20th and 21st centuries. Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

MAPH37818,Graduate,Open,Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM,"In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft. We will additionally discuss readings in modern criticism and theory to help us better situate our primary texts in the discourses of modernity and better understand their lasting resonances.",Tristan Schweiger,TBA,"Consent and Coercion: Rights, Agency, and Authority in the Eighteenth Century and Beyond",1,[42899],[],SEM

The tools of engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectual opportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies. Institute for Molecular Engineering The Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) is founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to address fundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of synthetic molecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapies to quantum computing. Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaboration and cutting-edge research well established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at the intersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, and physical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design at a molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment. Major Program in Molecular Engineering The BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineering curriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Courses are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; to introduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-ended technological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The program will both prepare undergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for further postgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law. The aim is to introduce invention and design, along with inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. Majors are able to choose from two quantitative engineering analysis tracks, one aimed at engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track, offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formally educate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level. MENG 29500 Engineering Design is a 300-unit design course offered as a capstone, in which student teams spend an intensive quarter working with a faculty mentor to solve an open-ended problem, for example, analyzing chemical and biological properties of cancer cells to develop new treatment and delivery vehicles or harnessing the properties of electrons in materials to develop quantum information technologies. The course also combines technical skills with an exploration of economics, regulatory and legal issues, and ethics. Major Program Requirements 1. A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative for a modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplines have had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to require biology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built across the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements at the highest level for which they are prepared. This will position them better to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, there will be two tracks for Molecular Engineering majors, one aimed towards engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one aimed towards applied physics. Students in the former track will follow precedent set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year 1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Students in the latter track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1, follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2. 2. MENG 26030 Introduction to Engineering Analysis. One of the first courses for all Molecular Engineering majors, this course teaches students to apply mathematical methods towards solving problems that cut across multiple engineering sub-disciplines. A major objective of the course is to teach simple programming skills and computational methods in applied mathematics, including the use of engineering software such as Matlab, Mathematica, Comsol, and elements of Python. The skills that are introduced here will be further developed and strengthened throughout the rest of the curriculum. 3. Two quantitative engineering analysis tracks: Biological, Chemical, and Soft Materials Engineering and Quantum Engineering. Reflecting the research and education themes of the IME, two highly intertwined but recognizably different tracks for the major are available to students. One is aimed at preparing students oriented towards biological, chemical, and soft materials engineering, and the other is aimed at preparing students oriented towards engineering of quantum-based materials, devices, and processes. The latter track is offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics. The main difference in the tracks relates to a choice between two sequences of three courses under the heading of quantitative engineering analysis. 4. MENG 29500 Engineering Design (300-unit capstone course). This “immersion” design course teaches students how to bring combinations of fundamental science and engineering together to solve open-ended and challenging engineering problems. It also serves as a vehicle to teach other equally important non-technical skills, including: • Problem identification: technology analysis, competitive analysis, market analysis, stakeholder analysis, product definition • Impact of the project, including sociological and engineering ethics • Project planning • Project economics: costs, value/investment analysis, risk analysis and adjustment • Prototyping, experimental design, data analysis, error analysis • IP: patenting, prior art, patentability • Legal and regulatory analysis • Proposing, presenting and reporting • Teamwork IME faculty and fellows will propose open-ended projects for which they will serve as mentors. Students will work together in groups of three. 5. Materials and advanced electives (3 required courses in the major). The major is offered in such a way as to allow for considerable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help from faculty advisors. Not only can students choose between two tracks, but they can further build breadth or depth through their choice of a materials course and advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their general electives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also in consultation with Molecular Engineering advisors, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduate school in more traditional engineering disciplines. 6. Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as part of their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering and the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data. Molecular Engineering majors develop these skills through lab components associated with required courses in the physical and biological sciences, Molecular Engineering courses including MENG 26101-26102 Transport Phenomena I: Forces + Flows; Transport Phenomena II, MENG 26201-26202 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics I-II, MENG 29500 Engineering Design, and some of the advanced electives such as MENG 27300 Polymer Physics and Engineering. We also anticipate that many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduate research projects. 7. Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia and industry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identified criteria for outcomes of students in accredited engineering education programs. Although there is no thought of seeking ABET accreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples of student outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process, or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many of these outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (emphasized in the design sequence and the research colloquium) and the College general education requirements. Students who are able to both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and for postgraduate study (engineering, medicine, law, and business administration). Entering the Program Students must indicate their intent to pursue the BS program at the end of the Autumn Quarter in their second year of study by completing the Intent to Pursue Molecular Engineering questionnaire (available on the IME website). They begin the engineering curriculum in the following Spring Quarter with enrollment in either MENG 26010 Engineering Principles of Conservation or MENG 26020 Engineering Electrodynamics. Both courses require the completion of their stated prerequisites. Students should work with their advisers early in their first year of study to plan for those prerequisites to be completed in a timely manner.

The overall objective of the program is to provide basic engineering tools and ways of thinking to students that augment scientific approaches and problem solving skills. Minor Program Requirements Before a student can declare the minor in molecular engineering, the student must: Complete the general education requirements in mathematics and physical or biological sciences Earn a B or higher in MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies Following completion of the general education requirements and MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies (with a grade of B or better), students may apply to the director of undergraduate studies of the Institute for Molecular Engineering for admission into the minor in molecular engineering program. A student must receive the director of undergraduate studies’ approval of the minor program on a form obtained from the student's College adviser. Once signed by the director, this form must then be returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of the student's third year. To earn the minor in molecular engineering, a student must complete five molecular engineering courses chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Before meeting with the director, students should invest some thought into which courses they would like to complete for the minor and how those courses relate as a set. MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies and MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering must be among the five courses counted toward the minor. In rare cases, courses offered by other departments and programs may be approved by the director of undergraduate studies as substitutes for courses listed above. Courses in the minor program may not be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, or (2) counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. Summary of Requirements for the Minor in Molecular Engineering MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies * 100 MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering 100 Three additional courses in Molecular Engineering or other programs ** 300 Total Units 500 * With a grade of B or higher ** Courses not in Molecular Engineering must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Grading In order to qualify for the BS degree, a GPA of 2.0 or higher (with no grade lower than C-) is needed in all courses required in the major. Students majoring in Molecular Engineering must receive quality grades in all courses required in the degree program. All courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades. Nonmajors and nonminors may take Molecular Engineering courses on a P/F basis; only grades of C- or higher constitute passing work. Honors Students who pursue a substantive research project with a faculty member of the Institute for Molecular Engineering are encouraged to write and defend an honors thesis based on their work. Students who wish to be considered for honors are expected to complete their arrangements with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of their third year and to register for one quarter of MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering during their third or fourth years. To be eligible to receive honors, students in the BS degree program must write a creditable honors paper describing their research. The paper must be submitted before the deadline established by the director of undergraduate studies and must be approved by the department chairperson. In addition, an oral presentation of the research is required. The research paper or project used to meet this requirement may not be used to meet the BA/BS paper or project requirement in another major. To earn a BS degree with honors in Molecular Engineering, students must also have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher. Molecular Engineering Courses MENG 20000.

Disease is a major factor in evolution; individuals who are relatively resistant to disease are the ones who survive and reproduce, and who transmit their genes to the next generation. Throughout most of human history, nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases were probably the major cause of infant and childhood mortality and thus were important factors in natural selection in humans. Culture has greatly altered the human environment, providing us with new but sometimes toxic foods, exposing us to new infectious diseases, and creating other conditions for which our evolutionary heritage has poorly prepared us.

As a matter of fact, scholars of Antiquity usually refer to Armenia only when it was involved into one of the frequent military crises between East and West. The country had an important strategic position, a vast expanse of territory, and wealthy natural resources. This explains very well the efforts of the Seleucids and of Rome, and of the Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and the Sassanids, to establish a military control and cultural influence over Armenia. Both contacts with the West and the East shaped the complex identity of Armenia - a somewhat mixed identity which is rather difficult to study. Therefore, both Classical and Iranian scholars tend to neglect the role of Armenia, or to diminish its position in the balance of power: the anachronistic cliché of a Greater Armenia as a «buffer state» is still mentioned. Accordingly, the few specialists on pre-Christian Armenia hardly communicate with those other scholars. Therefore, the very marginality of the kingdom of Armenia has not stimulated neither Classical scholars, nor Iranian scholars, to show interest in Armenia as well.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).",Angelina Ilieva,Foster Hall 408,The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise,1,[42378],[],LEC

NEHC20647,Undergraduate,Open,Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM,"This course examines the trajectory of Islamic political thought from the nineteenth century to the present day. Through a close study of key texts in this tradition, we will investigate how Islam has remained a vital source of principles and doctrines for a diverse array of political thinkers and movements over the course of the past two centuries. Developments in Islamic thought will be considered in the context of global trends, from the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and socialism to the liberation movements of the twentieth century and the confusion sewn by humanitarian crises of an unprecedented scale. Amidst these dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape, how have Muslim thinkers sought to ground their demands for dignity, autonomy, justice, and recognition? What do such claims have to do with the pursuit of personal and collective piety, on the one hand, and spiritual transcendence, on the other? Rather than framing Muslim political thinkers as reacting to global modernity, we understand them as key actors in shaping it, and our study of their writings will be oriented toward achieving a better understanding of the modern era as a whole. Our primary readings will take us from Istanbul, London, and the Nile Delta to Chicago, Tehran, and beyond, while our secondary texts will offer historical background and theoretical and theological context for the thinkers we focus on.

The main aim of this course will be to arrive at a reading of it that (1) situates it in the context of earlier philosophers’ writings about selves, memory, and consciousness, (2) is informed by an understanding of Locke’s own views concerning substance, consciousness, and memory, among other things, (3) carefully considers objections that later writers—most famously Butler and Reid—made to Locke’s theory.

In this course, we will consider the nature and significance of play, with a particular focus on the distinctively human form of play called games. The course will focus on three interrelated themes. (1) What are play and games? Drawing on thinkers like Johan Huizinga, Roger Caillois, and Bernard Suits, we will develop a vocabulary that allows us to tackle this question analytically, and to draw salient distinctions between kinds of play and games. We will also ask why humans and other animals play, and what form the answer to that question should take. (2) What is the value of playing? Sen and Nussbaum classify play as one of the basic human capabilities. Suits argues that playing games is central to the ideal human life. In investigating the significance of play to human life, we will also consider the ethics and aesthetics of playing. (3) How can thinking about play cast light on other human activities? Wittgenstein famously talks about linguistic activity in terms of games. Rawls uses games to think more generally about rule-governed institutions.

Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

Mill), we examine four types of contemporary philosophical feminism: Liberal Feminism (Susan Moller Okin, Martha Nussbaum), Radical Feminism (Catharine MacKinnon, Andrea Dworkin), Difference Feminism (Carol Gilligan, Annette Baier, Nel Noddings), and Postmodern ""Queer"" Gender Theory (Judith Butler, Michael Warner). After studying each of these approaches, we will focus on political and ethical problems of contemporary international feminism, asking how well each of the approaches addresses these problems.

PHIL34301,Graduate,Open,Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM,"One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.",Robert Richards,TBA,Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries,1,[42925],[],SEM

At the end of the twentieth century, the predominant view was that democracy had triumphed over fascism and communism and was secure in its standing as the sole legitimate mode of modern politics. Political theorists skeptical of this view argued that what had triumphed was not properly ‘democracy’ at all, often because political practice in modern democracies failed to measure up to a classical ideal. We will investigate uses of the ancient Greek past by modern critics of the theory and practice of liberal democratic politics. With a focus on post-war theorists like Hannah Arendt, Bernard Williams, and Pierre Hadot, we will ask how recovering aspects of the classical tradition might revitalize the modern theoretical and practical political landscape. By elucidating the political motivations behind, and implications of, the use of the ancient Greeks by these and other thinkers, we will clarify post-war critiques of the theory and practice of modern democratic politics that continue to influence theorists today.",Jared Holley,TBA,"Democracy, Ancient and Modern",1,[41782],[],SEM

There are over $3.7 trillion in municipal bonds outstanding and on average over $350 billion issued each year. This annual amount represents 10,000 separate financings. This market is critical to investors and the 87,500 state and local governments in the United States that need to meet the needs of their respective citizens. There are 55,000 governments with debt outstanding. Each week we will cover different aspects of tax exempt bonds and the various processes used to raise money for governments and not for profits.

PPHA32720,Graduate,Open,Mon : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM,"This course is about imagining the future – and developing a plan to make it happen. We will combine the theoretical and the practical. We will think creatively and philosophically about what could be, and work concretely on how to build it. Government is, everywhere, an industry in serious trouble. Its consumers are disenchanted and looking for alternatives, its products are failing the tests of quality and innovation, and its cost structure is too high. If governments were private firms, they’d be facing the dual prospects of either a takeover to “rescue” them or death in the competitive marketplace as their customer base migrates to newer alternatives. And, in fact, governments today face precisely those challenges. The idea behind this course is to address the government biz as exactly that: a mismanaged industry, business entity, or brand. We will study the history of the modern state and theories of how it will evolve in coming decades. We will consider what this means for the institution of government and what exactly “government” is. And we will look at what this means for the potential of private-sector, non-profit, non-governmental and trans-governmental entities to compete with the nation-state and take over its functions – and the possibilities that government can compete back and perhaps expand its own “business” line. But the course is intended to produce not just deep-thinking and new theories, but also concrete business plans. Students will be expected to identify either a new business idea or product line for a government entity to launch or a current government function that a for-profit or non-profit business can undertake to compete successfully with the public sector – and then develop a detailed business plan. This will require analyzing market opportunities, carrying out financial projections, understanding the realities of program delivery, and crafting a winning message for investors and/or voters. This will allow students not just to study cutting-edge literature on political theory but also to hone their practical business skills – and perhaps even start a successful business.",Eric Schnurer,Public Policy 224,The Future of Government,1,[43525],[],SEM

The courses objective is to teach you how to use these tools well enough to feel comfortable evaluating the quality of program evaluations that you are likely to review during your careers. The course begins by examining the elements of a cost/benefit analysis. Some of the principles we discuss during this part of the course are identical to those used by managers in a private firm when they consider whether to invest in new plant or equipment, to train their workers, or to initiate new human resource practices. But it also is important to recognize the differences between cost-benefit analyses of social programs and of private sector investments. Here we examine how the concepts of consumer and producer surplus discussed in your economics courses guide us in formulating evaluation questions and choosing appropriate outcome measures. Most of the course examines the strategies for evaluating the impact that government policies have on alternative outcomes. The key question here is what would have been the outcome had individuals, neighborhoods, state, etc., not been exposed to the policy. The impact of the policy is the difference between the actual outcome and this counterfactual outcome. Much social science research demonstrates that obtaining credible estimates of these impacts can be difficult.

PSYC23165,Undergraduate,Open,Wed : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM,"The past decade saw an explosion of empirical research in the study of morality. Among the most exciting and novel findings and theories, evolutionary biologists and comparative psychologists have shown that moral cognition has evolved to facilitate cooperation and smooth social interactions, and that certain components of morality are present in non-human animals. Developmental psychologists came up with ingenious paradigms, demonstrating that the elements that underpin morality are in place much earlier than we thought, and clearly in place before children turn two. Social neuroscientists have begun to map brain circuits implicated in moral decision-making and identify the contribution of neuropetides to moral sensitivity. Changes in the balance of brain chemistry, or in connectivity between regions can cause changes in moral behavior. The lesson from all this new knowledge is clear: human moral behavior cannot be separated from human biology, its development, and past evolutionary history. As our understanding of the human brain improves, society at large, and justice and the law in particular, are and will be increasingly challenged. Discoveries in neuroscience will soon impact our legal system in ways that hopefully lead to a more cost-effective, humane and flexible system than we have today.

REES21006,Undergraduate,Open,Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM,"Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).",Angelina Ilieva,Foster Hall 408,The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise,1,[42373],[],LEC

This erudite Polish author is a prime 20th century modernist whose novels, entangled in an ongoing battle with fundamental questions and, indeed, with existence itself, explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporary writers who established their reputation by applying existing philosophical models, Gombrowicz employed ironically his philosophical erudition, while engaging in his philosophical récit the literary and cultural tropes which derived from his Polish cultural heritage. Over the next ten weeks, we will investigate how he twisted these references and tropes to inform a distinctly Gombrowiczian version of performative philosophy. We will read Gombrowicz’s novels, lectures on philosophy and some of his autobiographical writings to seek answers to our overarching question: what makes this author a philosopher?",Bozena Shallcross,Foster Hall 408,Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher,1,[42358],[],LEC
REES31006,Graduate,Open,Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM,"Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).",Angelina Ilieva,Foster Hall 408,The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise,1,[42380],[],LEC

Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

Social class had great effect on one's social standing; economic well-being; political power; access to knowledge; and even longevity, health, and height. In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundly influenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps have even vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets access to the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care. So it is that schooling is sociologically interesting for reasons that go well beyond education.

In this course, we take up the difference in urban structures and processes. We will consider the “Third World city” a meaningful analytical category—to be distinguished, on the one hand, from the “First World” cities that inform so much of urban sociology, and, on the other, from global cities. We will spend the course discussing how and why these cities are different. In particular, we will talk about their explosive growth in the twentieth century, the precarious nature of urban employment, informal settlement as a major urban form, the housing divide as a social structure distinct to such cities, class formation, the impact of neoliberal reforms, democratization, urban spatial restructuring in the 1990s, and urban politics.

Psychotherapy for persons presenting with chronic distress present a unique set of challenges. Most research in psychotherapy outcomes suggest that one of the most important factors associated with successful treatment is the relationship between the client and therapist. Traditionally, focus on the therapeutic relationship has been the purview of experiential and psychodynamic therapies. However, in the past ten years, three behavioral models of psychotherapy have been introduced that focus on the relationship in the therapy session. To varying degrees, these therapies are based on a large body of knowledge developed over the past several decades in the study of verbal behavior. In this class, participants will be introduced to a behavioral conceptualization of phenomena such as emotion, memory, cognition, and beliefs. Discussion of these private behaviors will conclude in a presentation of a behavioral theory of the “sense of self”. For the remainder of the course, participants will revisit these concepts as they apply to discussion of three influential behavioral therapies. First, participants will become acquainted with specific clinician behaviors that foster the curative role of the therapist as articulated in Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) developed by Robert Kohlenberg. Second, participants will discuss the role of verbal behavior in human suffering and the “recontextualization” of painful private experience presented in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy developed by Steven Hayes. Finally, participants will be introduced to the therapeutic dialectic of acceptance and change as outlined in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) developed by Marsha Linehan. The goal of the course will be to briefly introduce participants to FAP and ACT and to provide an overview of the principles and strategies of DBT that explicitly address the diffuse, troubling experiences presented by most chronically distressed individuals.",Jancey Wickstrom,TBA,Fundamentals of Behavioral Therapy:  Contemporary Approaches,2,[42614],[],LEC

SSAD43800,Graduate,Closed,Thu : 09:00 AM-11:50 AM,"Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an empirically supported treatment originally developed for persons who struggle with suicide and/or parasuicide. It is a comprehensive treatment regimen focusing on the transformation of behavior responses to intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental factors contributing to problems related to impulsivity, emotional lability, cognitive dysregulation and interpersonal chaos. Due to its success treating various psychiatric populations, DBT is now considered effective with persons who engage in any behavior where the function of the behavior is to avoid or escape aversive thoughts and/or emotions. DBT was one of the first cognitive behavior therapies to integrate mindfulness, acceptance and willingness into treatment regimens that traditionally focus on change and control. It is therefore considered a pioneering therapy in what is now called the ""third wave"" in behaviorism. This class is intended to provide students with advanced training in the principles and practice of DBT. To that end, via lecture, experiential exercises, roleplay and a self-change project, participants will be exposed to the four components of DBT: Skills Training, Individual Therapy, Telephone Consultation and the Consultation Group. However, a basic tenet of DBT is that therapists should not expect their clients to engage in behaviors and activities they are unwilling to do. Therefore, emphasis in this class will be place on experiential knowledge. Therefore, interested participants will be expected to make a basic set of commitments that expose them to many of the emotional reactions experienced by their future clients. In addition to a self-change project, participants will commit to complete a diary card and practice mindfulness on a daily basis.

SSAD63700,Graduate,Open,Thu : 05:30 PM-06:30 PM,"ACT is an example of what is commonly referred to as a third wave behavioral therapy. It is unique in its development in that it was derived from some of the implications of basic research on the function of verbal behavior. This approach suggests that psychological distress is the result of how humans relate to their psychological experience rather than the result of a mental or even biological pathology. ACT assists clients in differentiating between those aspects of life where the only viable stance is that of acceptance and willingness and those where action is required given their desire to live meaningfully. In doing so, clients fundamentally shift from having their lives about their past and their problems to a life about their values and their future. This class is intended to provide students with a comprehensive overview of and practice with the principles of ACT. To that end, via lecture, experiential exercises, role-play and a self-change project, participants will be presented with the underlying theory (Relation Frame Theory) and assumptions of ACT, an ACT conceptualization of human suffering, a model of psychological rigidity and flexibility and the six basic clinical processes.

The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

While the genre is one often denigrated as staging lyrical utopias of Romance and adventure allowing audiences to escape depressing quotidian realities, many musicals did seek to engage some of the most pressing social issues of their day. In this course, we will look—and listen—closely to four differing musicals from the 20th century, studying their creative origins, while also analyzing their complex social meanings revealed through the story, music, lyrics, staging, and dance. Musicals to be covered: Show Boat (1927), Oklahoma! (1943), My Fair Lady (1953), and Company (1970).

The theoretical discussions and the dramaturgical exercises will focus on the following issues and the connections between them: 1. The agon and the encounter 2. Violence and the ludic logic of tragedy 3. Entrances, exits and supernatural interventions 4. Models 'for' and models 'of' theatrical and performative practices 5.

It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

Already, we can see that, perhaps, black theology might be the only theological discipline in the USA that did not originate in the academy. Instead, it was birthed out of people’s everyday lives searching for human dignity and a better community on earth. The course examines the 2nd generation of black theologians, starting with 1979. As the new body of knowledge progressed, thinkers saw the necessity to clarify its conceptual, theoretical, and theological positions. An entire body of literature, over half a century of writing, has arisen defining the methodological contours of this USA creation. This course explores the responses and critiques internal to black theology. Specifically, with a firm foundation set by the 1st generation of black religious scholars (1960s), we will now review the 2nd generation (1979 onward).
